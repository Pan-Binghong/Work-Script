    """Compute precision, recall, F-measure and support for each class.

    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label a negative sample as
    positive.

    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.

    The F-beta score can be interpreted as a weighted harmonic mean of
    the precision and recall, where an F-beta score reaches its best
    value at 1 and worst score at 0.

    The F-beta score weights recall more than precision by a factor of
    ``beta``. ``beta == 1.0`` means recall and precision are equally important.

    The support is the number of occurrences of each class in ``y_true``.

    If ``pos_label is None`` and in binary classification, this function
    returns the average precision, recall and F-measure if ``average``
    is one of ``'micro'``, ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` or ``'samples'``.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    beta : float, default=1.0
        The strength of recall versus precision in the F-score.

    labels : array-like, default=None
        The set of labels to include when ``average != 'binary'``, and their
        order if ``average is None``. Labels present in the data can be
        excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a
        majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,
        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in ``y_true`` and
        ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=1
        The class to report if ``average='binary'`` and the data is binary.
        If the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be ignored;
        setting ``labels=[pos_label]`` and ``average != 'binary'`` will report
        scores for that label only.

    average : {'binary', 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted'}, \
            default=None
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'binary'``:
            Only report results for the class specified by ``pos_label``.
            This is applicable only if targets (``y_{true,pred}``) are binary.
        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
            false negatives and false positives.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label). This
            alters 'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an
            F-score that is not between precision and recall.
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
            meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from
            :func:`accuracy_score`).

    warn_for : list, tuple or set, for internal use
        This determines which warnings will be made in the case that this
        function is being used to return only one of its metrics.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    zero_division : {"warn", 0.0, 1.0, np.nan}, default="warn"
        Sets the value to return when there is a zero division:
           - recall: when there are no positive labels
           - precision: when there are no positive predictions
           - f-score: both

        Notes:
        - If set to "warn", this acts like 0, but a warning is also raised.
        - If set to `np.nan`, such values will be excluded from the average.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3
           `np.nan` option was added.

    Returns
    -------
    precision : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        Precision score.

    recall : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        Recall score.

    fbeta_score : float (if average is not None) or array of float, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        F-beta score.

    support : None (if average is not None) or array of int, shape =\
        [n_unique_labels]
        The number of occurrences of each label in ``y_true``.

    Notes
    -----
    When ``true positive + false positive == 0``, precision is undefined.
    When ``true positive + false negative == 0``, recall is undefined.
    In such cases, by default the metric will be set to 0, as will f-score,
    and ``UndefinedMetricWarning`` will be raised. This behavior can be
    modified with ``zero_division``.

    >>> precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')

    It is possible to compute per-label precisions, recalls, F1-scores and
    supports instead of averaging:

    >>> precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred, average=None,
    ... labels=['pig', 'dog', 'cat'])

     array([0., 0., 1.]), array([0. , 0. , 0.8]),
